			<p><span class="big-text">I'm not winning an award for my consistent patience.</span> Sometimes that works to my benefit, usually, it doesn’t. I use Adobe software for a pretty substantial portion of my graphics work, and have for a long time. I’ve been using photoshop since version 5.5 when there was no ‘CS’ and CC wasn’t even a glimmer in Adobe and Macromedia's eye. I know where things are and how they should work, which is why when there’s an update, I brace for the change with this feeling of someone’s been in my stuff, what did they mess up.</p>

			<p>I work fast. Things get done in a flurry of keyboard shortcuts and muscle memory of how tools work. I do a lot of product photography so I have much of that procedure down to a very standard workflow. Take pictures, dump them in a folder, color correct in raw, open in photoshop, quick select what I want (this one will be important later), mask out what I don’t want, save, run image processor and upload web images.</p>

			<p>So there was this update in 2018, as there is every year, and I downloaded it and went to work when it was done. I got to the ‘quick select’ part of my work flow, which if your not familiar, quick select lets you select similar pixels so you can do things like mask out the background of the crappy makeshift studio where I take pictures and replace it with a crisp, white background so they look professional. The tool itself works by holding down the left mouse and dragging around the thing I want to separate and magically, there’s a selection so I can use to do that. On the day I updated tho, I click, I drag, I get a line of ‘marching ants’ that select nothing.</p>

			<p>I’m in a hurry. I have things to do. I’m pretty annoyed by this. I briefly did a search for ‘changes to quick select 2018’, didn’t see anything significant, and roll back to 2017 in anger and annoyance. That was dumb.</p>

			<p>An update can take about 30 minutes, so I lost roughly that amount of time, removing 2018 and reinstalling 2017, becoming increasingly more annoyed every time the progress bar stopped to take a nap or make a sandwich. What else could it be doing. In the meantime I searched for maybe 45 seconds to see if there was something those morons at Adobe did to my quick select, nothing. 45 seconds was surely enough time to assess the problem. I probably should’ve searched longer, but at this time I was convinced they hired some failed iPhone designer who had new ideas about how quick select could be made more - some term he learned in his overpriced design school and uses to make up the difference in his lack of ability - and he was gonna shake up the whole quick select world with his “genius”.</p>


			<p>Keep in mind, none of this is actually happening.</p>

			<p>So I roll back the update, I get my quick select back, go thru my workflow, smug that I had put Thad the software developer in his place. There’s no Thad, but if I’m gonna hate him, the name helps. I get to the point where I need to run image processor, which isn’t in photoshop, it’s in Bridge, which is still on version 2018. And guess what doesn’t want to play with Photoshop 2017? 2018 Bridge isn’t having it, so if I’m going to stick to the workflow I know, this must be rolled back too. Thad is smugly laughing in his overpriced black turtleneck.</p>

			<p>Not to be outdone, I revert to 2017 Bridge. Now this works again. So if you’re keeping track, between 2 reverts and a few random google searches, I’ve lost about 1 hour and 15 minutes or so. But I’ve won. I don’t have to use Thad’s busted software. I’m sure the internet is seething with rage at him for what he’s done. I don’t check to see if there’s a new tutorial. I don’t check the Adobe help. I don’t want to know. Things are back to the way they were. Solved.</p>

			<p>Months go by. I wrote a different article/rant about how Adobe is a bunch of pretentious morons for messing with something that worked fine already. I start getting the ‘this file is newer than you’re old 2017 version’ messages on client psd files. Because they updated their software like an adult. </p>

			<p>SO, I figure there has to be a way to use the new quick select. It can’t be completely worthless, can it? I begrudgingly update to 2018. Open an image of a shirt, click Quick Select, drag it over the image, ants… a single line of marching ants. I imagine Thad being torn apart by wolverines. </p>

			<p>In the options for this tool there’s a ‘brush size’. Quick Select uses this ‘brush size’ to determine how wide a swath of pixels you want to sample. The update reset my brush size to 1 pixel. When you drag a 1 pixel brush across an image, it only selects 1 pixels worth of data, which doesn’t really help you select larger areas, leading to… a string of ‘marching ants’. I just had the wrong settings. I increased the size of the brush and the tool worked fine.</p>

			<p>If I had taken the time to just figure out what the problem was, it may have taken a couple minutes to sort out what had changed. Instead I lost at least an hour and a half and an imaginary stereotypical software developer was torn apart by large ferocious members of the weasel family. </p>

			<p>Sometimes it’s just easier to find a fix to the problem. </p>
