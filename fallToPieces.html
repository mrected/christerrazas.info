			<h2>Problem</h2>

			<p>"Why can’t I just switch white ink to black ink when dealing with faces?" If you set up an your 1 color art, say a light colored face on something dark, you’re client will almost always say they want to change the background color and do something lighter than you intended, or vice versa, leaving you with nothing but heartaches.</p>

			<p>Most of the time if you’re dealing with a logo or something more than 1 color, this is fine. The problems typically start to arise when you do this with something that has a face.</p>

			<p>Take this image of Patsy Cline. With Patsy on the left, we’re printing her in ink lighter than her surroundings, and she looks ok. The white ink makes up her skin tones, whites of her eyes and the highlights of the image.</p>

			<p>Patsy on the right is the exact same imprint, except now she’s darker than her surroundings, and looks a little… crazy.</p>

			<div class="captionBox">
				<div>
					<img src="images/articles/goodPatsy.png" alt="patsy cline with correct imprint" class="articleImg">
					<p>Correct</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<img src="images/articles/badPatsy.png" alt="patsy cline with correct imprint" class="articleImg">
					<p>So Wrong</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>For a better example of this, drag the slider below the image to see what I'm talking about. Patsy stays the same shade of grey, only the background changes color.</p>

			<div id="patsyColorChangeDiv">
				<img src="images/articles/patsy.svg">
			</div>
			<div id="slider">
			  <div id="custom-handle" class="ui-slider-handle"></div>
			</div>

			<p>What's happening is when the shade of the background shifts beyond the shade of the art, it ends up making the image look more like a negative. If you're satisfied knowing the answer, you're done here. If you want to know how to fix this, read on...</p>

			<h2>Solution</h2>

			<p>The only real way to resolve this problem is to reverse what prints so the background color(s) show thru where the ink is now and prints where it isn’t. You can usually resolve this by putting an outline around the profile of your art, filling in where the negative space was and deleting what printed before, thus flipping what prints the highlights or shadows and makes up the image. Assuming your art is vector based (if you’re screen printing chances are it is anyway), here’s an easy way to get this to work before you go all to pieces.</p>

			<p>I'm using illustrator cc so all instructions will be based on that. Assuming your working with art that's in a vector format:</p>
			<p>So if you're starting with this...</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Starting with this...<img src="images/articles/patsy-step1.png" alt="original art of Patsy"></li>
				<li>Select all your art and copy it. <span class="code">ctrl/cmd+c</span><img src="images/articles/selected.png" alt="image of all art selected"></li>
				<li>Paste in front <span class="code">ctrl/cmd+f</span> and move it to a new layer over the current 1 and hide or lock the layer. <br><strong>Note - </strong><em>The "in front" is important. It makes sure your art aligns directly overtop of the original</em><img src="images/articles/layers.png" alt="original art of Patsy"></li>
				<li>Select only the original art, change the fill to a different color and release the compound path.<img src="images/articles/release.png" alt="image showing how to release compound paths"> This can be found under the "Object" tab.<br>What you're going for is a silhouette of the image, so you may need to get your pen tool and make the shape a solid<img src="images/articles/patsy-step2.png" alt="silhouette of Patsy"></li>
				<li>Turn on your hidden layer or unlock it. (again, stressing the importance of the original being in front of the solid shape).<img src="images/articles/patsy-step3.png" alt="silhouette of Patsy"></li>
				<li>Select all paths in both of these</li>
				<li>In your Pathfinder pallete (if you don't see it, Window>Pathfinder), click "Trim".<img src="images/articles/pathfinders.png" alt="screen capture of pathfinder pallete"></li>
				<li>Select all the color you don't want and delete it<img src="images/articles/patsy-step4.png" alt="reverse of original art"></li>
				<li>It's probably also a good idea to do a quick cleanup of this as well. </li>
				<li>You now have the reverse of your art!<img src="images/articles/patsy-step5.png" alt="final image of Patsy for use on lighter colors"></li>
			</ol>

			<p>That's pretty much it. Sometimes you may need to add an outline to seperate your art from the background. For the most part this is all that's needed to switch colors. This will obviously make it impossible to do things like have 1 print for every color, but at least you won't be left with the lovesick blues.</p>
