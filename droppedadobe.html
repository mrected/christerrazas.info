			<h1 class="sectionTitle">Photoshop. What has become of you<br><span class="heading-description">A long winded rant on why I rolled back Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 when I couldn't take it anymore.</span></h1>

			<p><span class="big-text">I’m a big fan of Adobe products.</span> I’ve used them forever. I know enough keyboard shortcuts and ways to automate jobs to reduce most complex jobs into a few minutes of actual work. Usually I welcome the new updates. Figuring out what new features are available and what weird and obscure tool is now available is not unlike opening presents. With the exception of the initial bugs that come with a new release that usually get hammered out in a month, I’m totally up for them. The release of photoshop CC 2018 however, mmmm, no.</p>

			<p>I do a lot of product photos in my line of work, so the Quick Selection tool is pretty valuable to me. Since I first learned of it I’ve been using its ability to make short work of separating images from their backgrounds. If you're not familiar with it, think Magic Wand tool, only it actually works. You basically click and drag around the stuff you want, it does a very quick and precise job of grabbing pixels by color groups, making it very easy once you have your selection to mask out the stuff you don’t want.</p>

			<p>2018 however: I click Quick Selection, and instead of the friendly immediate selecting of like pixels, I get a line of the “marching ants” as though I’m using the Lasso tool, only they essentially don’t select. Only after frantic scribbling this path over and over again does it realize “Oh, you wanted the grey pixels, not the white ones, and kind of selects part of them, leaving me to scribble again in the tiny remaining areas until it gets the hint that I want those too.</p>

			<p>Is this a bug? Is it a new and fun way of using this tool that worked just fine before? I don’t even know. There has been enough other weirdness with this rendition of it (cmd-z not switching between recent history states… sometimes, applying an adjustment layer to a layer with a mask and it defaults to adjust the mask, not the layer, why, really, why) that I don’t even care anymore. I’m pretty sure if I looked into, there would be a youtube video where someone’s figured it out or I could go on to the Adobe site and research why it changed, but I have actual work to do.</p>

			<p>If you're reading this Adobe, more particularly, if whatever team at Adobe handles hacking up working features and rehashing more confusing versions of them is reading this, we, the people that pay for your products work with them. We don’t care if you found a new way to get them to work. It’s not an iPhone. It’s not a car dashboard. It’s not a website. I use them because I know when I want to do something, I don’t need to think. My brain knows we’re going to do something, and sends the commands to my fingers and clickety-click, a jacket is separated from it’s background, resized, saved as a .jpg for the web. An image is given more contrast and inverted so I can use it to print shirts. The shit works the way it did yesterday!</p>

			<p>If it was a smart phone, I’d be annoyed that things we’re changed, but I’d be ok finding out how to use it again, because I’d lay in bed poking at it and occasionally say to my girlfriend, “oh look honey, this button can make crash satellites into Australia”. I’d get the feeling that I was discovering something new, not fighting with a hammer because it no longer hammered nails. If you want to include an option to a tool in the form of a dropdown or additional options, I’m good with that, but don’t change the way the entire things works. If I got up tomorrow morning and put bread in my toaster, pushed the lever and suddenly the lever had been replaced with a device that only makes toast when it recognizes I’ve blinked twice, I’d get a new toaster.</p>

			<p>Point is, in the interest of keeping workflows fluid and minimizing steps, it doesn’t make sense to alter the original in such a way that I need to stop what I’m doing, relearn how to use it, use it repeatedly enough that it sticks, because the engineers thought “Hey, this works great, but know what would be even better?... If it didn’t anymore!”</p>

			<p>I’ll probably revisit it sometime in the future. Maybe it’s a bug. I don’t know. I don’t care. Until then, I’m rolling back to the 2017 release.</p>
